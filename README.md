## PyBank
Given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv., I was asked to use Python to detemine the following: 
- The total number of months included in the dataset  
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period  
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes  
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period  
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
